Filename:

    <ssh address>:<path>   - connect to and transfer to/from this ssh addr
    <local path>           - transfer to/from this local addr
    <rsync addr>::<module> - rsync daemon; confusing

basic options:

    -v  verbose mode, show files as they're transferred
    -q  quiet

archive options:

    -a  archive mode. implies all of:
        -r  recursive
        -l  preserve symlinks
        -p  preserve permissions
        -t  preserve times
        -g  preserve group
        -o  preserve owner (superuser only)
        -D  preserve devices and specials
    -H  preserve hard links
    -R  use relative path names
    -L k

diff efficiency options:

       --inplace   update destination files in-place
       --append    append data onto shorter destination files
    -c --checksum  skip based on checksum, not mod-time & size
    -u --update    skip files that are newer on the remote
    -
    

reasonable normal-copy usage (skip based on mod-time & size):

    rsync <filename> <filename>

paranoid archive-mode usage:

    rsync -aHc <filename> <filename>

efficient transfer of large files usage:

    rsync -aHc <filename> <filename>
